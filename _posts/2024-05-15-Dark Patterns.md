# Dark Patterns and Disinformation At Every Turn

Most people who use a computer or mobile phone are accessing some sort of web application, be it a social media platform, website, or game. There are many sources that measure internet usage, but it's widely known that a majority of the U.S. regularly uses one of the following: computer, TV, smartphone, IoT device, or console. Whether primarily for work or personal use, users are falling victim to the UX crimes that many companies embed within their web applications.

*"A Dark Pattern is an interface maliciously crafted to deceive users into performing actions they did not mean to do. The results of the analysis show that 95% of the analyzed apps contain one or more forms of Dark Patterns and, on average, popular applications include at least seven different types of deceiving interfaces. The online experiment shows that most users do not recognize Dark Patterns, but can perform better in recognizing malicious designs if informed on the issue."*

It's important to consider these points:

- **Focus of the Study:** Some studies target popular websites/apps, which might be more likely to use dark patterns for higher traffic.
- **Deception Threshold:** There's no universally agreed-upon definition of a dark pattern, so some studies might include milder tactics.

While there's no single definitive number for companies using dark patterns, the research suggests it's a widespread issue, especially in mobile apps.

It can also be difficult to find more information about this, either because it is relatively new research, or dark patterns happen on more than just the websites you use. It's no secret that Google has been caught selling relevance in search results to the highest bidder. Molly Loe at TechHQ says, *"The all-seeing, all-powerful, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90% market share for online search has too much power to dictate whatâ€™s relevant, and relies too heavily on automation and, increasingly, AI,"* ([TechHQ Source](https://techhq.com/2024/01/google-search-optimization-ruins-the-browser/)). I've tried getting Google's LLM, Gemini, to supply more information about Dark Patterns, but halfway through constructing it, it hits a block and rewrites, *"I'm not able to help with that, as I'm only a language model."* While it's possible that this information could be intentionally redacted for various reasons, the Streisand Effect can help increase the number of people who are informed and, in turn, help make the internet a safer place. The Streisand effect is when an attempt to hide or censor something online backfires and brings more attention to it. It's like trying to cover up a fire with gasoline - it only makes the flames bigger. Although the Streisand effect can help expose the use of Dark Patterns, it may not be a reliable way for a large impact. It's important that the knowledge of Dark Patterns is spread and taught alongside computer basics or company trainings.

In recent years, Google has placed greater emphasis on using algorithms to automate search results. This has led to concerns that the human element in search quality control may have diminished. With the large tech layoffs in the past few years, it's very likely that Google may have entirely forgone human validation for search results. Google search is only a shell of what it once was but is reliable in disclosing who the highest bidders are. Lately, the amount of malicious content that could be found in the first few search results of a Google search has been noticeable even to the average user. Whether Google's search engine has had its data poisoned in recent years or its destruction was internal, the side effects will remain the same. How will people know if the information they're consuming is real?

Disinformation is becoming increasingly more common with the cyber war between the U.S., Russia, and China. With companies joining adversaries in spreading disinformation, albeit for monetary gain, it's beginning to feel like there is no one you can trust. It has never been more important to be hypercritical of the content you consume. It's also important to realize that you may never know the actual truth when it comes to the internet. Every bit of information consumed from the internet must be taken with a grain of salt. It's all too easy to create fake realistic-looking images and videos or fake statistics to peddle a specific idea. It's important to try and see the intent of the information and use that to help determine the validity of the content. For instance, a toothpaste brand telling you that they have the best toothpaste in the world should raise an alarm. Of course they want you to believe it is the best in the world, but how would you determine if it's true? There are many different ways that you can prove the validity of information, although it'd likely be best to learn from a scientific writing course. Science is still one of the most reliable ways that humans have to describe the world around them. Like any human-led effort, science can still be incorrect itself, so it's important to be able to determine whether or not something may be faulty science.

With every claim or definitive fact, there should generally be a source associated with that claim unless it is considered general knowledge. For instance, I don't need to source that the Earth is round, as it is generally accepted by a majority of the world. Sometimes referred to as 'the sauce', the source can quickly reveal the intent of the information, and that gives you more insight into determining the validity of the information. Not having dated information or having no author to attribute the information to are both textbook ways of revealing that the information is more likely to be incorrect or deceptive in some fashion. There are many different ways to help with the recognition of credible information, but for the remainder of this article, we'll only be focusing on understanding Dark Patterns.

There are so many instances of Dark Patterns in nearly every single website, but Dark Patterns are still widely unknown to the average user. Although these Dark Patterns are a result of the UX design deployed by these companies, there is no better way than to intercept these forms of deception than at the user level. Once these Dark Patterns become easier for you to see, it's possible to become more resistant to falling for the psychological tricks.

There are several different dark patterns used in web design and applications, all aiming to trick or manipulate users into actions they might not take willingly. Here are some of the most common ones:

- **Confirmshaming:** This tactic uses guilt to discourage users from unsubscribing or opting out of something. Wording like "Are you sure you don't want to be awesome?" or "By leaving, you'll miss out!" are examples of confirmshaming.

- **Disguised Ads:**  These are ads that are made to look like regular content or navigation elements, fooling users into clicking on them unintentionally.

- **Bait and Switch:** This pattern lures users in with an advertised offer but then makes them jump through hoops or pay extra to get it.

- **Hidden Costs:**  This involves presenting a base price but then adding on mandatory taxes, fees, or other charges during checkout, making the final price higher than advertised.

- **Roach Motel or Forced Continuity:** This makes it difficult for users to cancel subscriptions by requiring them to jump through hoops or navigate complex processes. Imagine a hotel where you can easily check in but find it very difficult to check out. In web design, this translates to making it easy to sign up for a service but difficult to cancel it. This might involve burying the unsubscribe option under layers of menus or requiring users to contact customer service.

- **Privacy Zuckering:**  Named after Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg, this pattern involves making privacy settings complex and confusing, leading users to unknowingly share more data than they intended.

- **Misdirection:**  This tactic uses misleading visuals or language to distract users from important information or nudge them towards a particular action.

- **Price Comparison Prevention:**  This involves making it difficult for users to compare prices between different products or services. This could be achieved by using complex pricing structures or hiding key information.

- **Trick Questions:**  These are phrased in a way to trick users into selecting the unintended option. For instance, a double negative question where "no" means "yes" to unsubscribing.

- **Sneak into Basket:**  This involves automatically adding unwanted items to a user's shopping cart during checkout, hoping they won't notice before completing the purchase.

- **Friend Spam:**  This pattern tricks users into sharing something or signing up for a service by implying it will be shared with their friends, even if that's not necessarily the case.

It's important to be aware of these dark patterns to avoid falling victim to them. If you encounter something suspicious, take your time, read carefully, and don't hesitate to abandon the process if it feels like manipulation.

While looking for more information on Dark Patterns, I stumbled upon a hub of Dark Patterns found in the wild: [Deceptive Design's Hall of Shame](https://www.deceptive.design/hall-of-shame?brand=Google)

Although the sources may not be very trustworthy, as they come from random individuals, it's easy to validate their claims yourself with your own personal accounts. Dark Patterns are also so common that, after learning even a few of them, you can start to pick them out yourself on nearly every website.

You'll notice many of the common techniques used to manipulate users listed in Deceptive Design's Hall of Shame. One of the most common is tech companies using Privacy Zuckering to trick users into consenting to the use of all their personal data. This one is one of the most common tactics because free services have turned data collection and selling into a multi-billion-dollar industry. Although most of these data brokers call the data deanonymized, the very nature of knowing everything about you defeats the purpose of deanonymization. Who cares if someone doesn't know your name if they know your schedule, what apps and services you use, your spending habits, what you look like, how you act, where you are, or even where you're likely to go? This information is more than enough to use in a social engineering attempt that could attack your finances, and scams that do that are becoming increasingly more common.

Individual scam attempts have been rapidly evolving with newer tactics to deceive and manipulate people into divulging confidential information. Gone are the days where you can see someone in a zoom call and know that it is really them. The ability for programs using AI to make realistic video and sync it with lip movement is becoming more than just uncanny. It's starting to become indistinguishable from the real deal. While the internet moves closer towards actualizing the Dead Internet theory, information will become harder to discern the validity of ([Dead Internet Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory)).

There needs to be more thought put into people's ability to authenticate who should have access to specific information. With the current rate of breaches occurring in the U.S., we will hopefully start to see more awareness about Digital Privacy, your digital footprint, discerning disinformation, and information security.

The most powerful tool in determining the validity of such information will always be critical thinking. Utilizing that noggin with a healthy amount of skepticism goes a long way when determining the truth. It's also best to reduce your amount of assumptions. Only assume after validating those assumptions and try to be generally more inquisitive. What ways do you notice your favorite websites employing Dark Patterns to trick you?
