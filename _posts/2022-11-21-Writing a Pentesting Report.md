# Writing a Pentesting Report

## A beginner's guide to writing a pentesting report.

### "The report is more important than the hacking that produces the report, because the report lives on, and the hacking is just how you get there,"(Brian 'BB' King). 
While hacking is often seen as the most valuable part of being a pentester, it's only as good as the report that contains it. With the proper report, a hack can become much more valuable than just understanding an exploit.

### Programs and Practice

It's important to be well versed with a writing program, such as Microsoft Word. Not only will being accustomed to a program make the writing easier, but it will be easier when it comes to formatting and editing. Every step of the writing process should be focused on conveying information well and it's important that this comes easy for a pentester. This typically means staying in the correct tense and writing in the correct perspective, such as third person. To practice technical writing, start out small by writing blog posts or reading other professional pentesting reports.

### Intentions

Well written reports will properly show the perspective of the hacker. When explaining how SQLi works, a reader must understand how the 15-character limit input field was bypassed. If they aren't understanding how the character limit was bypassed, then they need a better understanding of the hacker's point of view. Include every failure in the report. When something didn't work, let the client know what was preventing it. After informing them of the failure, compliment them. "I wasn't able to do any SQL injections due to the developerâ€™s keen attention to input validation." This style is extremely valuable for letting clients know their successes and that their successes should be celebrated. A pentester can do more than just improve a client's security. A well written report can harbor a healthy security culture for a company.

### Audience

Think about the different audiences of the report. There are typically two audiences for a penetration test report: the technical people, and the business people. As far as capturing a good technical perspective, try to write descriptively enough that a beginner in IT could understand. Show the technical people how it was done with detailed steps. Don't explain exactly how Burp Suite works, tell them that Burp Suite was used to enumerate, brute force, etc. Screenshots are a must-have in the technical description. A perfectly crafted screenshot can be the difference between a mediocre and outstanding report. Screenshots needs to be helpful, relevant, accurate, precise, and add useful information. If a screenshot is only text, recreate that text so it is searchable in the document. Show each command that was typed when vulnerability was exploited. The step-by-step should be informative enough that IT personal could follow along and complete the hack themselves. 

For the business side of the report, make sure they understand how to secure their system in their own language. This is most important in the executive summary which should be included in every report. This executive summary is a simplified explanation of the pentest placed at the beginning of a report. It shouldn't be too involved, but it should highlight the main changes an executive or company should make to secure their data. Make sure they understand the basics. They need to know that stealing hashes means encrypted passwords have been stolen. State that the cleartext password was then obtained. Point out that the password policy allows users to choose weak passwords. Make it clear that the actions the pentester took could have been detected or prevented.

### Formatting 

When it comes to formatting, use a cover page. They need to know who made this report multiple years down the line. Make a Table of Contents and use good headings. This is extremely important and even more so the denser the report. Make the Executive Summary 1 page or less. It's okay to make it longer if necessary but try not to. Assume some people have colorblindness. If using colors, be sure to also use appropriate symbols such as a warning sign or a critical risk sign for clarity. Appendices can also be very helpful, depending on how long the report is.

### Things to Avoid
There are many things to avoid when writing a report. Copy and pasting from another report is a big mistake. If a copy and paste error gets past the final edits, it will not only ruin the report, but it will ruin the pentester's reputation. Having a template is fine and encouraged, but if any info of another report is sent to the wrong company, it can have legal ramifications. Do not copy and paste from a vulnerability scanner. The client doesn't need to see a page or two on something they can do themselves. Instead, show a graph of risk analysis or a graph of the most important vulnerabilities to fix.  

Never assume the client knows as much as the pentester. Stay away from phrases such as "This is so simple," and "This isn't that complicated,". This sort of writing is demeaning and terrible for capturing the audience. Tagging along with the latter, don't ever assume or imply that the client is stupid. A pentester's goal is to properly convey the penetration test to the client and if they aren't understanding it, it's most likely the pentester's fault.
