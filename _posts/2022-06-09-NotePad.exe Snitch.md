In this blog post, I follow along John Hammond's "[Notepad.exe Will Snitch On You (full coding project)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSSBbv2fc2s)".

Windows 11's notepad.exe will save notes in a local cache and retain data that users didn't intend to save. Even if you didn't save, you can close out of notes and reopen them with your previous unsaved note. This means this local cache can be extracted while on a user's machine to gain more info about what they do, or what they use notepad for, if at all.

The file path:
```
%localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsNotepad_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\TabState
```
Text files use letters, numbers, and symbols that we can read but .bin, or binary files, use 0s and 1s to represent the information.

Because of that, .bin files can hold various types of data, like:

* Images
* Videos
* Audio
* Software programs
* Disk backups

The problem is that since it's just ones and zeros, your computer can't necessarily understand what kind of data it is without some extra information.
